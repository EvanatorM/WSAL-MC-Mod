# **WSAL MC Mod**  
_A Fabric Mod for the WSAL Minecraft Server_  

---

**Welcome, n00bs!** This is the official mod for the WSAL Minecraft server, run by the *almighty* WSAL Evan. Yeah, that's right. If you're not using this mod, you’re missing out big time—like Kenny trying to dodge a bus. So, buckle up, kiddos, 'cause I’m about to lay down everything you need to know.  

---

## **What is WSAL MC Mod?**  
This mod is here to make **Evan's Minecraft server** more fun and ridiculously chaotic, like me on a good Taco Tuesday. You get custom features, special items, and, let’s face it, some serious OP nonsense—'cause why play fair when you can WIN HARD?  

---

## **Features**  
🎯 **Custom Mobs:** Evil chickens? Check. Exploding sheep? You know it.   
⚒️ **Insane Weapons:** Swords that shoot lightning and fish that... slap real good.  
🏠 **Structures:** Custom dungeons and hidden treasures (if you can find 'em, losers).  
👑 **Events & Minigames:** If you’re not participating, don’t cry when you get left out like Butters.  

---

## **Installation**  

1. **Step 1:** Install the **Fabric Mod Loader**, dum-dums. No Fabric, no fun.   
2. **Step 2:** Put the mod `.jar` file into the `mods/` folder of your Minecraft installation. If you don’t know how to do that… well, figure it out or ask your mom.   
3. **Step 3:** Join WSAL Evan's server. You’ll find the address somewhere on his **YouTube channel**. You ARE subscribed, right?

## **Contributing**  
Listen here, you can totally contribute to this mod. If you’ve got ideas for features or find a bug (probably because you were messing with it like a moron), **open a pull request**. But if you’re gonna whine about getting your code rejected, save everyone the trouble and don’t even try.

## **Support**  
Having issues? That’s probably ‘cause you’re bad at Minecraft. But if you’re sure it’s a bug, open an **issue on GitHub**, and we might consider fixing it. Or we might laugh at you. Either way, entertainment will be had.
